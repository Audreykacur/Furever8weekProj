    <h2> What is Furever?</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px" >

        An increasing number of people stayed home and began working from home during 2020 and 2021.<br> The ASPA estimated based on a survey that during this time approximately 23 million American homes <br>
        adopted an animal or pet. As the prevalence of working from home increases, people seek companionship <br>
        in the form of a family pet to have near them. Traditionally adoption of pets is completed in two ways, <br>
        one: visiting shelters online or in person, and two: adopting from people in local areas through personal <br>
        contacts of social media. Additionally, There is no centralized or mainstream method to easily find family <br> 
        pets and see if those pets are a match for adoption like there are for other services like dating or finding <br>
        homes. Modern day society is all about creating the most of your time and spending the rest of your time <br>
        with your loved ones. We have taken the needs and wants of millions wishing to adopt a pet and the <br>
        requirement of the modern day idea of making life easier, to create Furever. <br><br>
        Furever is a service that allows individuals seeking pets <br>
        for adoption to view and match with pets being listed <br>
        by adoption agencies or people seeking to rehome their pets. <br><br>
    </p>
    <h4>How does it work</h4>
    <p>
        
        Adopters: Individuals seeking to adopt a family pet. <br> 
        Adopters will be able to independently sign up for an
        account and <br> enter their personal information and basic requirements for the <br>
        animals they wish to seek. These requirements will later be used in a Furever <br> 
        filtering system to connect them with a pet that fills those needs.
        <br> The adopter will be granted access to search for their furever pet by viewing <br>
        pets posted for adoption on a card format, on which they will swipe right to <br>
        indicate they like the shown pet option, or left to indicate they do not want the <br> shown pet option.<br> If you have any addition questions head over to the FAQ page or contact customer support
<br><br>
Sellers: Any individual wishing to rehome an animal they 
        are <br>currently in possession of. Our Furever application is set<br>
         up where any individual wishing to add a pet for adoption can <br>
        contact us to verify their credibility. We verify adoption 
        agencies, <br>humane societies, and all animal shelters, along with 
        individuals who are<br> not associated with an agency wishing to 
        rehome their  current family <br> pet. All those verified have access
        to add animals to our site under their <br> username. Furever does not 
        wish to give for-profit pet breeders<br> a place where they can
        easily sell their dogs for money.</p>
