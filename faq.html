                <p>
                    Furever will display animals that our current algorithm matches (ex. animals requirements with your
                    information). If you like the furbaby that displays on your screen we ask that you swipe right.
                    There is
                    no
                    way
                    to display previously displayed animals that were not swiped right on. You can swipe right on
                    whichever
                    animals
                    you find to be favorable that match your requirements. The owner of that current pet will then be
                    able
                    to
                    see
                    your name, phone number and they will connect you if a match is made.
                </p>

            <button class="accordion">Is there a limit to how many pets I can swipe right on?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Currently there is no limit. However, please only swipe right on fur babies that you are serious
                    about
                    adopting.
